			     ALARM CLOCK

struct sleep_list_elem
{
	int64_t tick; // after how many ticks thread need to wake up
	struct thread* curr_thread; // which thread going to sleep
	struct semaphore* sem;	// Semaphore for unblocking sleeping thread
	struct list_elem list_el;  // For inserting into sleeping list

};

I have created struct sleep_list_elem for store details of threads which are going to sleep.This struct has a 
semaphore which block the specific thread and number of ticks after it need to wake up as attributes.

struct list sleep_list; // to store sleeping threads
struct lock sleep_list_lock; // Lock for  sleep_list 

I created sleep_list variable to store current sleeping threads and sleep_list_lock for lock the sleep list to 
avoid concurrency issues.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

Old code used busy waiting in timer_sleep function.What I did is when a thread going to sleep I store it in 
sleep-list_elem variable with semaphore and ticks.After ,I insert this variable into sleep_list according to 
ascending order of ticks.In timer_interrupt function ,at each tick ,function checks the first element of sleep_list 
and release the thread by sema_up if thread need to wake up(ticks are passed) else stop traversing.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

To minimize time I insert sleep_list_elem according to ascending order of ticks.By this we can ensure that all 
elements has greater remaining tick than first element.So it is enough to check only first element.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Even if multiple threads call timer_sleep function only one thread can access sleep_list at one time because I have 
used sleep_list_lock to lock sleep_list.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

If timer interrupts occur during a call to timer_sleep function timer_interrupt handler can't access sleep_list 
because sleep_list is locked by sleep_list_lock of thread which call timer_sleep function.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

I inserted sleep_list_elem in a sorted manner.Then time complexity to pop correct thread  from sleep_list is 
reduced and amount of time spent on timer interrupt handler also reduced.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct thread
  {
    ///////////////////

    struct list lock_list;             //locks that current thread has acquired 
    struct lock *thread_lock;          //pointer on lock that thread could be locked on
    int donation_priority;             //priority other thread has donated 
  }

In struct thread I have added more three variables.I added lock_list to store locks that threads has aquired,
*thread_lock to point the lock that thread could be locked on and donation priority to store priority other thread 
has donated.

struct lock
  {
    
    /////////////

    int priority;             //max prioirty 
    struct list_elem lock_list_elem;   //list element for lock list 
  };

In struct lock I have added priority to store priority of thread which hold the lock and lock_list_elem 
to store list element for lock list.


>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.


I have not created any specific data structures to track priority donation.In my implementaion I keep two priority 
values in struct thread by priority and donation_priority variables.And I had used lock_list variable,*thread_lock 
pointer to save locks which thread owns and lock which thread wants.Plus I created priority attribute in struct lock 
to keep the priority of thread which currently accured that lock.

 
---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

Semaphore

We don't need to consider sema_down because if any thread want to down specific semaphore we put that thread into 
sema waiters list.But problem is ,when we up semaphore ,which thread going to use that semaphore.For this in sema_up 
function I traverse through sema->waiters and select thread which has maximum priority by help of thread_compare_fun 
and then remove that thread and unblock it.

Condition variables

cond_signal function wake up a thread which has a highest priority by sorting the cond->waiters list and then pop 
the front element.

Lock

There is no issue in lock_acquire function.But there is a issue that when releasing lock which thread from wait 
list going to acquire that lock.This issue can be solved by sema_up function call itself.
 
>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.

When a call to lock_acquire causes a priority donation I change the priority of lock and donation priority of 
lock_holder.If the current thread can acquire that lock after donation, previous lock holder release the lock and
current thread become a lock holder ,thereafter I push that lock into lock_list of current thread.Else current thread 
going to block state by sema_down function.


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

When lock_release is called the current thread is no longer the holder of lock and lock's priority and 
donation_priority of current thread is set to PRI_MIN.Then the waiting thread with highest priority can aquire 
lock without any priority donation.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

I have keep a seperate variable donation_priority to track donated priority value .Therefore I never used 
thread_set_priority function.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

I didn't use seperate structures to track priority donation.Instead of track I had used some variables to already 
established structures such as priority to struct lock and lock_list,thread_lock,donation_priority to thread.Then 
we don't need to traverse through each struct.We can gain quick access to variables.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts. You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

All are too hard.It takes more than 20 hour to complete.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

Hints are not enough.I can't guess what to do.For that I search hardly in internet find more hints and guidances.
My peers also help me lot.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

I recommend to give a overview of lab.Give a guidance on what we need to do,how can we approach problem may 
reduce our workload.
